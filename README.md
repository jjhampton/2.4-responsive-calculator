# Responsive Calculator

A browser-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript intended to replicate the functionality of Calculator.app on the Mac computer.  

I built this in week 2 at The Iron Yard Academy to practice including Javascript variables and functions on a live web page.

##Live Demo:
* http://jjhampton.github.io/2.4-responsive-calculator

##Tools & Techniques

- JavaScript variables to store calculated values
- Javascript function declarations to do basic arithmetic in JavaScript
- Javascript functions and event listeners to respond to user interaction
- SASS and Bourbon for CSS styling and layout
- Bourbon Neat grid for responsive design at various screen sizes
- CSS transitions to make the buttons appear 3D and to "press" when clicked

##Install Dependencies:
* Modern web browser - Chrome / Firefox / Safari
* `$ bower install bourbon`
* `$ bower install neat`

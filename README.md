# Responsive Calculator

A browser-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript intended to replicate the functionality of Calculator.app on the Mac computer.  

I built this in week 2 at The Iron Yard Academy to practice including Javascript variables and functions on a live web page.

##Tools & Techniques

- JavaScript variables to store calculated values.
- Javascript function declarations to do basic arithmetic in JavaScript.
- Javascript functions and event listeners to respond to user interaction.
- Bourbon Neat grid for responsive design at various screen sizes
- CSS transitions and styling to make the buttons appear 3D and to "press" when clicked

###Installation:
* Other than a modern web browser, no additional requirements

###Live Demo:
